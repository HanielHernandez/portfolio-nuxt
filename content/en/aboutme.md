#### About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, My Name Is **Haniel HernÃ¡ndez**, I'm a **Front-End Web developer** currently living in **Nicaragua**, started working on web development back in **2017** after graduating as a **System Engineer** at **UCA (Universidad Centroamericana, Managua, Nicaragua)**

What I like about Front-End Web development it's that it's the part of the application that the final clients interacts with, the final experience, and in a certain way it's an art in the sense that you're using your creativity to share Ideas through visual elements.

By no means do I consider myself to be a master web developer, I have a long way to run yet, but through this last few years I've gained quite some experience that in my opinion makes me a pretty capable web developer, able to learn fast and solve problems, and that would help your team you reach their goals and deliver quality software.
